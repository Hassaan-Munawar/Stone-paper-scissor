ðŸš€ Excited to Share My Project: A Rock-Paper-Scissors Game! ðŸŽ®

I'm thrilled to showcase my creationâ€”a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. ðŸŽ‰ In this game, the user selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the bot automatically makes its choice. The result is then displayed instantly, making it a quick and engaging experience.

This project helped me dive deeper into JavaScript logic, enhancing my understanding of event handling and DOM manipulation. The sleek and simple design ensures a smooth user experience, and I'm really proud of how it turned out!

ðŸ”§ Key Features:

Intuitive user interface
Real-time result display
Responsive design for all devices
